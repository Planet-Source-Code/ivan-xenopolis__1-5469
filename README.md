### Description

I wrote this "game" quite some time ago when I hardly had any experience. It's horribly buggy. I'm going to work on improving and correcting it. I apologize for any inconveniece caused.

This was the original description:

A strategy game where you have to manage your planet and make it prosper, you also have to defend it from pirates. You can also activate multiplayer mode and play with a friend across a local area network. Sounds have also been implemented. (They're horrible!) This game need a lot of improvement. =) Enjoy! =)
 
### More Info
 
You need the winsock control to play across the network.

None - Not sure though
